# Quality of Service Anomaly Detection in Wildfire Monitoring Networks Using Vision Transformers
*Understanding how Vision Transformers can act as effective models for anomaly detection in outdoor cameras.*

## Instructions

### 1. Create virtual environment and install dependencies
  Make sure you have:

- Python 3.12 installed  
- `pip` installed

Check versions:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

#### Windows
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Ensure necessary files are included
  In order to train a model and/or perform inference, labeled data from LabelStudio is necessary and must be in the form of a CSV file. This data is not publicly avaliable. The following instructions pertain to those who have access to the file containing the data.
  By default, the program checks for a file named `coronado_hills_data.csv` in the `camera_data` directory. If you wish to use a different name and/or location, please refer to the `--labels-csv-name` and `--camera-data-dir` arguments respectively. .

### 3. Run program
  If you wish to use the default settings, simply run:
  ```powershell
  python main.py
  ```
  This will download the images to the `camera_data/images/` directory, train a new model, place its weights (named `model_weights.pth`) in the `weights/` directory, and save the training, validation, and test set embeddings 
  generated by the model to the `embedding_data/` directory. If you wish to change these default settings, run the following command to view documentation for each of the arguments:

  ```powershell
  python main.py -h
  ```
